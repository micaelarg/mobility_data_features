- add more external features; 
- there is an Unnamed: 0 feature in feature importante -- didn't change the name because it has zero importance, but it deserves the name;
- stats data 
	-- add more relative to the different hex_ids
	-- it says 1066 but this includes duplicates, which I solve for predition, but not here. There are around 760
